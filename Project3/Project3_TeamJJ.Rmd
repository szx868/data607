## Introduction

In God we trust, all others must bring data.” Please use data to answer the question,
“Which are the most valued data science skills?” Consider your work as an exploration; there is not necessarily a “right
answer.”

data set from https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer



```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
